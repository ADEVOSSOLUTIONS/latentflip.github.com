  <h1>Reflections on &quot;Rejection&quot;</h1>
  <p>Yesterday (Monday) morning, I was on my way to work with a pretty heavy case of the Mondays. Call it laziness, depression, apprehension, whatever, but most of the fibres in my body were screaming &quot;go back to bed&quot;.</p>

<p>In an effort of procrastination, and to come to my senses, I dived into Press Coffee for an espresso, and started reading <a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/">The War of Art</a> - my current self-help book of choice for the struggling creative.</p>

<p><img src="http://assets0.qypecdn.net/uploads/photos/0109/0741/P1012144_gallery2.JPG" alt="Press coffee"></p>

<p>I came to a page on rejection, and how the fear of rejection holds us back from the things we want to do, and a flash-back from the day before, of a young man in a swimming pool saying publicly &quot;I failed!&quot; about his first ever high-dive attempt, came in to my head.</p>

<p>Something compelled me to start writing about this event, and my thoughts and reflections on it, so I opened my hardly used notebook (I don&#39;t write very often) and just started writing the story, and my thoughts, as they came into my head. Here&#39;s a photograph of one of the pages, proof as it were:</p>

<p>It was freeing to just write, unplanned, for myself, without censorship, and for no real purpose, other than to write and think.</p>

<p>Feeling more relaxed, and somewhat pleased with myself for having written my first piece of &quot;creative writing&quot; in 10 years I headed into the office to start the work day. Since I can&#39;t be trusted not to lose anything physical, I posted the story on my <a href="http://blog.latentflip.com/post/29820876915/rejection">blog</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_roberts/status/237490322597371904">tweeted</a> in the faint hope that I&#39;d get a &quot;nice story!&quot; or something of that ilk.</p>

<h2>Hacker News</h2>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, <a href="http://twitter.com/semanticist">@semanticist</a> posted <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4406910">a link</a> to the story on Hacker News, and it somehow made it&#39;s way to the #2 spot on the front page.</p>

<p>This is what being at the number 2 spot on the front page does to your Google Analytics:</p>

<p>For reference, for the entire 18 month period prior to yesterday, my blog had about 2000 unique visits, total. So a 6-fold increase in 24 hours is somewhat significant.</p>

<p>The full run down of the fallout of this moment of internet fame was:</p>

<ul>
<li>12,676 unique visitors</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/latentflip">Over 70 tweets</a> linking to the post from people I don&#39;t know</li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4406910">25 comments</a> on Hacker News, ranging from &quot;awesome post&quot; to suggesting I must have lived a sheltered upbringing to think such things.</li>
<li>88 click throughs from my blog&#39;s about page, to my startup <a href="http://floatapp.com">Float</a>. Absolutely not why I wrote the post, but interesting nonetheless.</li>
<li>3 new twitter followers (a whopping 0.023% conversion rate).</li>
<li><a href="http://kerr.io/rejection-done-right/">A blog post</a> in response to my post. Which, even though it&#39;s not particularly positive, I&#39;m pleased that it stirred up something in someone.</li>
<li>Confirmed reports that the post made at least 2 mothers cry (certainly not my intention).</li>
<li>One day almost entirely lost to checking Hacker News, Twitter, and Google Analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s pretty much it. The post is now long gone from the Hacker News homepage, I haven&#39;t signed a book deal, nobody bought our startup for a billion dollars, I still woke up this morning the same apprehensive-about-going-to-work-me that I did yesterday. But I&#39;m pretty okay with that.</p>

<p>The irony in all this of course, is that if I had sat down yesterday morning thinking &quot;I&#39;m going to write a post about rejection that&#39;s going to get on the front page of Hacker News and be read by over twelve thousand people around the world&quot;, I would have probably never finished it. The fear of rejection would almost certainly have held me back.</p>

  <h1>Freaking Out is Not Constructive</h1>
  <p>A lot of Lib-Dem voters seem to be freaking out about the fact that Nick Clegg is in talks with the Conservatives. I am certainly no political analyst, but I think a lot of people could do with taking a step back and chilling-out a bit. Here are my thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Like it or not the Conservatives received more votes, and more seats, than any other party in this election. </p></li>
<li><p>Nick Clegg and the rest going behind the Cons&#39; backs to create a coalition government hardly smacks of fairness, and puts the LibDems at risk of backlash from an expanded Conservative base many of which are clearly ex-Labour voters who are fed up with the current Labour government.</p></li>
<li><p>By courting the Conservatives, the LibDems can make the demands they would see fit for forming a coalition. Hopefully these include significant compromise from the Cons on Immigration, defence, and most importantly electoral reform.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Conservatives cave on their demands (which seems unlikely to me), then we have a significantly diluted Con-Lib government. Yes it might not be exactly what you voted for, but get over it. A LibDem majority was a (very long) shot, and it&#39;s much better than a Conservative only government. Also with electoral reform in place, we are in a much better position for the next election.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Conservatives don&#39;t give in (which seems much more likely), then Nick Clegg will be free to say &quot;sorry, we tried, the Cons are being unreasonable&quot;, and go to Labour and the rest and try to form a majority government.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly Nick Clegg could cave on all the important issues, and form a coalition anyway. If that happens then by all means start a riot. Otherwise, just chill out: the LibDems haven&#39;t betrayed you yet. Instead of fuming at them, why not send them a reminder of which issues are most important to you for forming a coalition: http://38degrees.org.uk/lib-dems.</p>

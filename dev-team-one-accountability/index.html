  <h1>The dev team of one&#58; accountability</h1>
  <p>Being in a technical team of one can really suck sometimes.</p>

<p>One of the problems I have is accountability. I am not directly accountable, nor working with, anyone in particular. The only people I am really dealing with on a technical difficulty are <em>past me</em> and <em>future me</em>.</p>

<p>The trouble is, I am not very nice to <em>future me</em>, and <em>past me</em> is not very nice to me. I am in fact, considerably more less nice to <em>future me</em> than I would be to probably any other human on earth. I screw up his code base, check in code when the tests don&#39;t all work, write some of the crappiest git commits possible. Here are a choice few:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;err&quot;: (3 changed files with 38 additions and 9 deletions)</li>
<li>&quot;close&quot;: (4 changed files with 3 additions and 122 deletions)</li>
<li>&quot;Smart decimals&quot;: (9 changed files with 73 additions and 47 deletions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, douchebag.</p>

<p>But, recently the wonderful <a href="http://stevenrbaker.com/">Steven Baker</a> offered to help out with Float from time to time, so I gave him access to our GitHub repo. It didn&#39;t occur to me that he would now see all my crappy commits in his GitHub feed until this happened:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="271207001852366849"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/philip_roberts">philip_roberts</a> Anothing tip: commit message should say “why”. Look at your latest commit, the diff and the message both tell me what.</p>&mdash; Steven R. Baker (@srbaker) <a href="https://twitter.com/srbaker/status/271207749600301056" data-datetime="2012-11-21T11:05:40+00:00">November 21, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Since then I have been <em>much</em> more considerate about the commit messages I post. Just knowing that they will show up in <em>his</em> feed is enough to make me take the few extra seconds to do a good job.</p>

<p>This has got me thinking about two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>There must be lots of other ways to build this kind of mini, friendly, accountability in to my workflow, to keep me on the right track.</li>
<li>If anyone else needs a commit message over-seer I will happily help you out!</li>
</ol>

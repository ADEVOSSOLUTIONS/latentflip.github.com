  <p>When you are working through something difficult, it&#39;s often useful to look for a source of inspiration. Something you would love to have created yourself, something to aspire to.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really struggling, inspiration can just be depressing. A sober reminder that maybe you will never be <em>that</em> good, the creeping doubt that maybe, you suck.</p>

<p>Well, if it&#39;s a nasty piece of HTML and CSS you are stuck with, I have a great piece of <em>un</em>spiration for you. Take a look at these:</p>

<p class="image"><img src="http://media.latentflip.com/images/posts/twitter_tables.png" alt="Twitter screenshot with tables highlighted"/><span class="caption">Twitter, with tables highlighted in dashed blue.</span></p>

<p class="image"><img src="http://media.latentflip.com/images/posts/stack_tables.png" alt="Stack Overflow screenshot with tables highlighted"/><span class="caption">Stack Overflow, if you love the tables so much...</span></p>

<p>Twitter and Stack Overflow have used tables for a significant portion of their layout! That forbidden, carnal, sin! These big-shots, who everyone knows of and talks about, are <em>(probably)</em> bigger cheaters than you are.</p>

<p>Feel better now?</p>

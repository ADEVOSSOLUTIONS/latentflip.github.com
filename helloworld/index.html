  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>Well <a href="http://edu.blogs.com">Ewan McIntosh</a>, I hope you are happy. This is at least the third blog (the other 2 I know of being <a href="http://www.hilarysinger.com">Hilary&#39;s</a> &amp; <a href="http://roderickhodgson.com">Roderick&#39;s</a> you have started after your recent berating of all the blog-less attendees of BarCamp Scotland 2009.</p>

<p>As well as being a response to Ewan&rsquo;s bullying, this blog was started for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>A place to muse on my experiences in electronics, web development, design, usability and so forth.</li>
<li>To beat Hilary&#39;s blog, <em>So It Goes</em>, to a race to the top of a google search for our respective names.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sadly, it&#39;s going to take something of a miracle to win that race, given that Hilary Singer is apparently a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hilary+singer" title="Google Search">very uncommon name</a>.</p>

<p>Oh well, I&#39;ll just have to focus on content then.</p>

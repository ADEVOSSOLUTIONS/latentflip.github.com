  <h1>A logo for introverts</h1>
  <p>I love the idea of a logo for us introverts. I&#39;m not sure why, perhaps as a way of legitimising us.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas. My favourite variation so far is:</p>

<p><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/3921/screenshots/709087/simple.png" alt="Simpler"></p>

<p>which grew from:</p>

<h3>The hamster ball</h3>

<h3>Dashed hamster ball</h3>

<p><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/3921/screenshots/708985/introvertlogodashed.png" alt="Hamster ball 2"></p>

<h3>The fish bowl</h3>

<p><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/3921/screenshots/709004/fishbowl.png" alt="Fish bowl"></p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning towards the dashed line, as it makes it clear it&#39;s a guideline, rather than hard and fast rule, for an introvert&#39;s personal space.</p>

<p>The concept of the hamster ball, and later fish bowl, came from: <a href="http://blog.latentflip.com/post/30513286517/how-to-live-with-introverts">How to live with introverts</a>, but I prefer the simpler, version as it&#39;s not very obvious what the other shapes are.</p>

<p>What do you think? Any other ideas?</p>

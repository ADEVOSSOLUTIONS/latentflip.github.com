I build javascript web applications, and I'm good at it.

If you're looking for someone to lead; to help you build quality frontend applications, and to be just darn _nice_ while doing it, you should get in touch: [phil@latentflip.com](phil@latentflip.com).


### What I'm good at

* I've been building complex javascript web applications like [float](http://floatapp.com) and [talky.io](https://talky.io) for 7 years.
* For the last 18 months I've been frontend lead at &yet - directing frontend strategy for us and our clients, and educating other developers.
* I have considerable experience with [backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [ampersand](https://ampersandjs.com) (I was a core contributor) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) & [redux](http://redux.js.org/) (which I love working with). I have written large apis and backends for applications in both rails and node.js.
* I am an excellent communicator and educator. I [write](http://latentflip.com) and speak well on a range of topics: my [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) talk has been watched over 200,000 times. In my time at &yet I have made _many_ of our clients very happy both with the quality of my work as well as my ability to communicate clearly with them and anticipate and understand their needs.
* I co-founded and built [float](http://floatapp.com) for 3 years. As the sole developer I built the entirety of the initial platform - taking it from the first line of code to revenue; as well as working with my co-founder to do customer & product development, design, ux, customer support & sales.
* I've built a number of realtime applications using webrtc and xmpp, including talky, and client applications for &yet.
* I am not a _designer_, but I care deeply about UI, UX and design, and the impact they have on products and customers. I've worked closely with &yet's design team over many projects to implement, question, stress-test, break and improve designs.
* I am an exceptionally fast learner and _great_ at tracking down bugs (seriously, try me). Which means I'm very comfortable jumping into existing codebases and becoming productive quickly.

You can also check my [github](https://github.com/latentflip) and full [cv](http://latentflip.com/cv).

### What I'm looking for

* A permanent position either in Edinburgh, or remotely where there are a good number of people in UK/European timezones
* A senior frontend javascript position, or something a bit different that might fit my skill-set
* A team who care about each other as well as the work they do

### Why now?

After 3 years at the wonderful [&yet](https://andyet.com), I've decided to move on.

I love everyone on the team to bits, but over time the distribution of our remote team has shifted significantly to the West Coast - and working 8 timezones away from a team I love is hard work.

I don't have anything lined up yet, and I'd love to hear from teams who think I would be a good fit.

### Contact Me

A "real man":

* Defends his honour with his fist.
* Never cries.
* "Mans up".
* Makes jokes about his "ball and chain".
* Oggles attractive women, wherever possible.
* Shouts as communication.
* Hides his emotions.
* Cares about "number one".
* Enjoys beer, the more the better.
* Can fix anything, or he's a failure.
* Is always in control.
* Encourages friends to have another beer.
* Never lets a friend leave a party early.
* Makes fun of people wherever possible.
* Favours trouble over peace.
* Loves watching sport more than anything.
* Drives a fast car.
* Earns more than his wife.
* Always wins.
* Is as strong as an ox.
* Feels bad about failing at any of the above.

Fuck that. I'm done with it.

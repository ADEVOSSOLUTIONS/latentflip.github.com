  <h1>Same-same, but different</h1>
  <p>Whenever I have a merge conflict after merging from a branch into another with git, I get confused which bits came from where:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/435934.js?file=gistfile1.diff"></script>

<p>In retrospect it&#39;s actually pretty straightforward. HEAD always refers to your current branch in git, so from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; to ==== is what was in the branch you started in, and ==== to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is what was in the branch you came from.</p>

<p>Easy. When you know how.</p>

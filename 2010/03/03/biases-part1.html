  <h1>Biases, part 1</h1>
  <h3>It&#39;s all in the brain</h3>

<p>The world is full of biases. Some of my favorites are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive</a>, which frequently result in people (myself included) misinterpreting information, or making poor/wrong decisions, when they believe they are being rational and logical.</p>

<p>Being aware of these common biases is very useful, both for finding weakness in arguments you make, as well as in those of your &quot;opponents&quot;.</p>

<h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>

<p>Confirmation bias is one that seems to be very common<sup>1</sup>: the act of seeking or interpreting evidence to confirm a belief you already have; ignoring or not looking for evidence which would counter it. </p>

<p>A recent example pulled from Facebook is a statement such as this (and I don&#39;t mean to make it personal, it&#39;s just a good example):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do so many people get the words lose and loose mixed up? Is it a generation thing, because it only started happening visibly in the last few years. Maybe an Internet-speak issue? Curious...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that there is no hard evidence (that I am aware of) that this statement is true, it seems much more likely that confirmation bias is at play, playing out something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Misuse of lose <span class="amp">&amp;</span> loose is fairly obvious to someone who knows their correct usage; whilst their correct usage is almost unnoticeable. So there is a built in bias to overestimate incorrect usage.</li>
<li>Almost as soon as the hypothesis is made, the incorrect usage will be even <em>more</em> noticeable, as it will be conscious in your mind (a similar effect to learning a new word, and suddenly notice it being used everywhere). Correct usage will still go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Anger ensues at the &quot;kids these days&quot;, making said infractions even <em>more</em> noticeable.</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to deal with it</h3>

<p>I have found that simply knowing that confirmation bias is a thing, with a name, has helped me identify when I, or others, are falling prey to it. </p>

<p>Examples like the above are pretty harmless, but I see/suffer from it all the time in the workplace: people collecting more and more &quot;proof&quot; to support their hypothesis, whilst ignoring, downplaying, or not even looking for information that would disagree with it.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are one place where a little meta-thought (thinking about the way you are thinking) can go a long way. Whenever you are trying to confirm a theory, try and look for counter-examples, as well as supporting evidence. Many a mathematician would tell you it&#39;s a powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction">technique</a>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The irony of this statement should be clear upon finishing this post.</p>

  <h1>Mass Media is Dead (to me)</h1>
  <div class="post-date">22 March 2010</div>
  <p>It has been a long time since I&#39;ve had a television. Apart from perhaps the odd occasion at other people&#39;s houses, I haven&#39;t really watched television since I lived at home 6 years ago.</p>

<p>Partly this is because a lot of my attention has been consumed by the internet, either bouncing from blog-post to blog-post on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, or building bits of the web for <a href="http://www.moustachewars.com/">fun</a>. The other reason is that the majority of the shows trotted out are utter trite. </p>

<p>Sure, there are a few gems from <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.co.uk/">across</a> <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/">the</a> <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/archer/">pond</a> which I can&#39;t get enough of; and the BBC has a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/planetearth/">few</a> <a href="http://www.qi.com/tv/">gems</a>. But they also have crap like: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00htyc7">Snog Marry Avoid</a>, of which the title alone makes me feel physically ill.</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of the phrase &quot;the democratization of the internet&quot;, but it&#39;s certainly true. I have recently come across a few videos that could almost certainly not have existed in &quot;traditional&quot; television; yet have felt more human, and evoked more emotion in me than most of the junk on the magic box ever has.</p>

<h4>Where the hell is Matt?</h4>

<p>Guy called <a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/index.shtml">Matt</a> travels the world, dancing. Sounds simple, but holy crap is it powerful. Watch it, then try and tell me <em>Big Brother</em> has a place in this world.</p>

<h4>Chat Roulette Piano Improv</h4>

<p>On the one hand Chat Roulette is probably my mother&#39;s worst nightmare - unmoderated, seemingly pointless, probably full of genitalia. On the other, it&#39;s connecting total strangers in the rawest sense, and enabling cracking videos:</p>

<h4>Douglas Adams: Parrots, the universe and everything</h4>

<p>An intensely interesting, and rather amusing, lecture by Douglas Adams about his adventures finding endangered species. This may not quite be as &quot;user generated&quot; as the other two, but I can&#39;t imagine it seeing the light of day, in full, on TV. </p>

<p>Well, maybe at 4am on a Sunday morning, but that doesn&#39;t really count.</p>

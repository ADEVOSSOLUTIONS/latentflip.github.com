  <h1>A few live coding tips</h1>
  <p>Last night at <a href="http://scotrug.org">Scotrug</a> I live coded some of <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">ToDoMVC</a> in Backbone.js to introduce Rubyists to Backbone and how it looks &amp; feels.</p>

<p>Since it went surprisingly well, I thought I&#39;d share a few quick tips:</p>

<h3>Keep it simple</h3>

<p>The todo list app I wrote is very simple (and I didn&#39;t even finish it), but complex enough to demonstrate the basic elements and power of backbone.</p>

<p>The power of live coding isn&#39;t to show off how fast you can type, how complicated you can make something, or even really to show people code, but to give you a stage to talk through the elements and design choices of what you&#39;re building. The simpler it is, the more time and energy you&#39;ll have to talk.</p>

<h3>Think of your audience</h3>

<p>I thought pretty hard about what I could expect my audience to know, and what I couldn&#39;t. You want to remove as much extraneous talk and code as possible - so if you&#39;re confident that most people will know something, don&#39;t just throw it in anyway. Keeping it out will keep their minds clear for the important stuff - and give you less code to make mistakes on.</p>

<p>The flip side of course is that you need to make sure you set the stage for what you are doing, and don&#39;t assume too much of your audience, or you&#39;ll lose them quickly.</p>

<h3>Think like a beginner</h3>

<p>In the demo, I did a lot of back and forth between writing a little bit of JS in VIM, then using Chrome&#39;s console to play with the code I had just written (<a href="http://blog.dotsmart.net/2011/09/30/change-font-size-in-chrome-devtools/">here&#39;s</a> a quick guide to increasing the font size so the audience can read it). I got a couple of compliments on that approach, I think because it helped me drive home the point at each step - rather than just diving ahead and writing the whole app at once.</p>

<p>I also added a couple of small &quot;deliberate mistakes&quot;, mostly around JavaScript&#39;s async nature, to keep people thinking, and not just drifting off because everything was going too smoothly.</p>

<h3>Practice, publicly</h3>

<p>My preparation for the demo went something like: </p>

<ul>
<li>Built the app up from scratch completely, keeping a README explaining what I was doing and why, and carefully committing at every logical step.</li>
<li>Dumping it all and doing the same thing again from scratch a couple of days later.</li>
<li>Going through the commit logs and deciding what stuff was extraneous, and where I should actually start my live coding (I didn&#39;t want people to get bored watching me setup a rails app).</li>
<li>I then put a shout out on twitter to see if anyone wanted a one-on-one tutorial. Thankfully @ryanstenhouse did. So I took him through the demo from start to end in a bar. This was the best prep. I did: it added a bit of pressure, and weeded out a few more mistakes I was likely to make. His enthusiasm also gave me the confidence that it was a good idea, and people would find it interesting. It also meant I had an ally in the audience who could help spot my bugs if something went really wrong.</li>
<li>I did a final run through, recording myself via quicktime to get an idea of how long it might take, and to help me focus on slowing down and not making mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>And finally...</h3>

<p>Pray that the demo gods are on your side...</p>

<p>Look out for the video which should be popping up online in the next week or so.</p>

  <h1>Live as if you'll die in ten years</h1>
  <p>I learned recently that two of my friends are going to die. Not today, hopefully not tomorrow, but in all likelihood they will die before I do.</p>

<p>This was shortly followed by another realisation: all of my friends are going to die: not today, hopefully not tomorrow, but they will die.</p>

<p>As will I.</p>

<p>The human brain isn&#39;t very good at reasoning about the future. One bias we suffer from is hyperbolic discounting. Tell me I&#39;ve got 60 to 70 years left on this earth and I&#39;ll probably just shrug - it&#39;s too far in the future to really comprehend, and whether it&#39;s 60 or 70 doesn&#39;t seem that important.</p>

<p>Tell me I&#39;ve got 20 years, and I might start to take note. 20 years is barely enough time to have a kid and see them leave home.</p>

<p>Tell me I have 10 years - which is approximately the life expectancy of my two friends - and I can tell you for a fact that the mere thought may send me into a bawling mess, full of fear and regret and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Tell me I have a month, a week, a day? I can&#39;t even begin to imagine what my reaction would be - but I am certain that it would be strong.</p>

<p>Since learning about my two friends&#39; conditions I have been considering life a little more carefully. The phrase &quot;live life as if you will die tomorrow&quot; comes to mind as a supposed way of waking us all up to the realities of life: but it doesn&#39;t quite work for me. The probability of me dying tomorrow is very low. The upper bound for dying tomorrow in the UK, assuming it is accidental, is roughly 0.00008% - and given that I am in a rather low risk line of work, it&#39;s probably much lower than that still. So as scary as dying tomorrow would be - it doesn&#39;t seem all that likely - and it&#39;s hard for me to get too worked up about.</p>

<p>&quot;Life as if you&#39;ll die in ten years&quot; though - that&#39;s a little more horrifying. My brain quantifies 10 years as being long enough such that something bad could actually happen - yet short enough that if I knew for sure I had 10 years left, I&#39;d hope I&#39;d change some things about the way I live.</p>

  <h1>Fresh, free music with Sonic Router</h1>
  <p>I recently came across <a href="http://www.sonicrouter.com/category/sonic-router-mixes/">Sonic Router</a> which have a nice collection of dubstep/electronic/hip-hop mixes from various artists. One of my favourites so far is by <a href="http://official.fm/tracks/236466">Lapalux</a>.</p>

<p>Bored of opening the Sonic Router homepage, finding the list of mixes, choosing a random one, hitting play, I knocked up a <a href="https://gist.github.com/2584960">little Ruby script</a> that opens a random one in your browser. And if you have dotjs installed there&#39;s a little snippet that will autoplay too.</p>

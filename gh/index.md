Hi Github,

Please find my CV attached for the [Senior Software Engineer](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/953424) role.

I have been a full-stack web developer for the last 8 years, working directly with customers to understand their needs, and leading remote teams to build great products like [floatapp.com](http://floatapp.com) and [talky.io](http://talky.io).

I am now looking for opportunities to ship software at greater scale, and to further grow my skills as a leader and a mentor. From speaking with Mike McQuaid I've been impressed by how GitHub values communication and empathy within teams.

I am currently travelling in France with my family until early March, but would be glad to setup a phone or video call to see if it's a good fit.

Regards,

Philip Roberts

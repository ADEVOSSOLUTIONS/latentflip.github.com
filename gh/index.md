Hi Github!

I'd love to apply for the [Senior Software Engineer](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/953424) role.

I have been shipping web applications like [floatapp.com](https://floatapp.com) and [talky.io](https://talky.io) in small teams for the last 8 years. I am driven to understand people's problems and find ways to solve them, and my experience in small teams means I am not afraid to get my hands dirty wherever there is a need, and get stuff done.

I love learning from the people around me, and teaching and mentoring others, like in this very popular JSConf talk: [youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ).

Through my recent roles at &yet and Surevine, I've come to believe that with great people, empathy and solid communication, remote teams can ship world-class software, in a way that is healthy for everyone involved. It is clear that GitHub thinks the same.

I am good at what I do, but I want to get better. I am excited by the opportunity to ship software at GitHub's scale, to have more customers to learn from and solve problems for, and to have great people around me to collaborate with, learn from, and mentor.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Philip Roberts

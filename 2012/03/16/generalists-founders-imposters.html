  <h1>Generalists, Founders and the Impostor Syndrome</h1>
  <p>As the technical co-founder of a web startup, it&#39;s easy to think of yourself as a software engineer first and a founder second. This is patently wrong and potentially dangerous for your mental health.</p>

<p>To make my case, here is a list of job titles that I could quite easily give myself based on the work I have done <em>this week</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Business analyst (considering the benefits and implications of switching payment provider)</li>
<li>SysAdmin</li>
<li>Data analyst (running analytics on some data to see if it can help us find a solution to &quot;the big problem&quot;)</li>
<li>System architect (planning how our application should integrate with a new API)</li>
<li>Rails developer (integrating our web application with the new API and a new payment provider)</li>
<li>JavaScript developer (building our backbone.js based webapp)</li>
<li>Front-end developer (building out the HTML and css for our webapp)</li>
<li>UI/UX Developer (trying to improve our sign-up flow)</li>
<li>Marketing (improving our pricing plan communications, blogging about our company&#39;s second birthday)</li>
<li>Copywriter (both in-app microcopy, and marketing copy on our website)</li>
<li>Design (designing/building a page to thank our Founder members: http://floatapp.com/founder_plan)</li>
<li>Customer support (interacting with users via email and phone calls)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t say all this to boast or complain, it&#39;s simply a fact. As the technical half of a two-person company, I have to cover a number of different roles. </p>

<p>Truthfully, I love it. I have been, and always will be, a generalist. However, I also push myself to be the best at every individual thing that I do—no small feat given the list above—and this is where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in. Instead of evaluating my performance holistically, I tend to compare myself against experts in each of the roles I perform.</p>

<p>For example, with my JavaScript developer hat on, I think of myself as a JavaScript developer, not a founder. This means I start comparing myself to other JavaScript developers (like some of the <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas">best</a>, <a href="https://github.com/derickbailey">in</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maccman">the</a>, <a href="https://github.com/froots">business</a>. At that point I start to feel inadequate. The trouble is, I do this for all my hats: compare myself to the best in the business for each vertical. At that point I start to feel <em>really</em> inadequate.</p>

<p>Having spoken to two other co-founders with similar feelings this week, it&#39;s clear that this is a foolish mindset. A more appropriate perspective is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a capital-f Founder, not a JavaScript developer, or Rails developer, or designer or customer-support guy. I will still strive to be the best in the world at each of my hats, but if I don&#39;t quite make it that&#39;s okay—I&#39;ll just hire them one day instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shift in thinking has a had a massive positive effect on my mental health—but I&#39;d love to hear what other founders think?</p>

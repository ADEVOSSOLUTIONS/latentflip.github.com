# Back(end) to Front(end) lessons from the JavaScript trenches



# Declarative FTW

- Almost everyone comes from a procedural, or imperative, programming background, if this then that.
- Imperative programming makes a lot of sense for business logic. 
- Imperative programming SUCKS for building user interfaces, and defining user interactions.
- Here declarative wins, every time.

- Why?
  - When we are building user interfaces we DO NOT CARE about the how. All we care about is the WHAT. I want this here, I want this to do that, I do not care how.
  - Thinking about the how is super messy and gets in the way

- Thankfully, front-end libraries are evolving towards more declarative styles
  - First there was jquery
  
  - D3.js
  - Bacon.js
  - Angular

## Senior JavaScript/Frontend Developer

I am an experienced JavaScript developer, currently focused on building complex frontend web applications with React and Redux, particularly combined with XMPP and WebRTC.

I also have considerable experience with building backend applications with both Node.js and Ruby on Rails.

I care deeply about building usable, performant and maintainable web applications. I am a skilled communicator and educator of technical concepts, both when teaching junior developers and giving conference talks.

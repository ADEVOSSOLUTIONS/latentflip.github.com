## Web Application Developer

I’ve been building complex web applications like [Float](https://floatapp.com) and [talky.io](https://talky.io) for 8 years. I am committed to empathising with the needs of customers, the business, and developers, to build web applications that people want to use, and developers want to work on.

I enjoy working with other developers, and love teaching through mentoring and conference talks.

I am an experienced frontend JavaScript developer, but am not afraid to work anywhere in the stack: from the database, through to deployment. I am as comfortable working from a blank slate as I am jumping into existing codebases, and I am not afraid to ship.

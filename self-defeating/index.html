  <h1>Giving up on self-defeating self-talk</h1>
  <p>The mind is a powerful thing. </p>

<p>It can convince us that ghosts exist; that the position of the planets demonstrably affects our lives; that the answer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> is not &quot;choose the other door&quot;. </p>

<p>It can convince us we hate foods that we later come to love; that the aged mouldy excretions of a cow&#39;s mammary glands are in fact a delicacy.</p>

<p>It can convince us that innocuous eight legged beasts 1/60,000 of our own weight are terrifying; whilst striped, fierce, clawed, fanged creatures 5 times our weight are cute.</p>

<p>It can convince us that other human beings don&#39;t deserve to live because of the colour of their skin, or the country they were born in.</p>

<p>It can convince us to <em>end our own lives</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Might it not be then, that this mind of ours, while powerful, is often pretty stupid. </p>

<p>That perhaps sometimes we should question the validity of what it tells us, or ignore it completely. </p>

<p>That when it says &quot;you suck&quot;, or &quot;you are stupid&quot;, or &quot;you are not worthy&quot;, that perhaps it is <em>wrong</em>. That perhaps we should not give into, or even <em>enjoy</em> this feeling, and fight it instead. Banish it along with all the other myths, and fallacies, and fantasies, and biases that a mind crafted over 3.8 billion years comes up with when it is placed in a modern world free of <em>genuine</em> threat and scarcity.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

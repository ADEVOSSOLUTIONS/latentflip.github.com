  <h1>Founder depression, and a meetup proposal.</h1>
  <div class="post-date">20 April 2012</div>
  <p>As both a <a href="http://blog.latentflip.com/post/19403885675/generalists-founders-imposters">capital-F founder</a> and developer, the last 12 months have been tough. I have personally been stuck in some pretty deep lows, and of the assumption that I was the only one struggling with a lot of questions about who I am, what I am doing, and whether I&#39;m good enough to do it.</p>

<p>The last couple of months have been a lot better, triggered by a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Going to the doctor:</strong> who said lots of nice things like &quot;what you are doing sounds really hard&quot;, &quot;the most common thing I see in this room is depression&quot;, &quot;yes it looks like you have mild depression&quot;, &quot;here&#39;s some practical things you can do that aren&#39;t drugs&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking to an (off-duty) counsellor:</strong> possibly the most &quot;productive&quot; hour I have spent in a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Writing that <a href="http://blog.latentflip.com/post/19403885675/generalists-founders-imposters">blog post</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>But the most powerful thing has been opening up to a number of different founders and developers about what I&#39;ve been going through, and them replying with &quot;<strong>wait, I say those things all the time too - I thought I was the only one</strong>&quot;. The following relief of finding someone else going through the same stuff has been palpable for both of us.</p>

<h3>A proposal</h3>

<p>As a result of this, I am thinking of starting a meetup/support-group in Edinburgh to help founders, developers, and anyone building products share some of their <em>personal</em> experiences with this stuff and learn from each other.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t got it all figured out yet - so I&#39;m looking for feedback, but here&#39;s some rough thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Non-technical/business</strong>: we have plenty of technical meetups, this is a place to reflect on our <em>selves</em> rather than code/biz. Clearly a lot of our emotions are affected by the work we are doing - but the focus is definitely on the personal stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Open to anyone related to running businesses/building stuff</strong> (not just founders)</li>
<li><strong>Confidential:</strong> at the meetup: share, otherwise: shush. :)</li>
<li><strong>Supportive, not dismissive</strong>: I think this goes without saying. None of this: &quot;oh, sure, that&#39;s easy, you can just fix yourself by â€¦ eating more! My problem is much more serious!&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Small</strong>: I&#39;m not sure how we would manage this if the group became a run away success, but I think at least initially it would be good to try and keep the groups small as sharing this stuff is hard enough as it is.</li>
<li><strong>Format</strong>: As a first meeting, I am thinking I would talk about some of the stuff I&#39;ve been going through, and see if we can use that to kick-start a bit of a group discussion and take it from there.</li>
<li><strong>When/where?:</strong> I&#39;d like to have a first meeting soonish, but I haven&#39;t got a venue - so if anyone has any thoughts for somewhere that&#39;s free, I&#39;d love to hear them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what do you think? If you are at all intrigued, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you&#39;d fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/latentflip.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFFoLTV4d3BTTzBLX3BWemxnVEZVeWc6MQ#gid=0">this quick form</a> just so I can gauge interest (and collect feedback if you have any). Thanks!</p>

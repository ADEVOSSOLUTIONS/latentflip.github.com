  <h1>Anonymous Pen Pals</h1>
  <p>I&#39;ve recently been thinking a lot about <a href="http://tchspprt.co.uk/">Tech Support</a> and how exactly to get that ball rolling.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been thinking about the role the internet plays/can play as a support network. The internet has a huge potential for helping people - just look at Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow where software developers seek for almost every software problem imaginable. When it comes to more personal matters though, there is a big problem - that our personal and professional lives are so intertwined on the internet.</p>

<p>It can be hard enough to discuss and share your concerns about your daily struggles or mental health without worrying about whether your present or future employer/clients/colleagues will come across it online and judge you, or treat you differently because of it.</p>

<p>So what can we do? I don&#39;t have the answers, but something I&#39;ve been thinking about is trusted anonymity. Would a closed network of trusted (i.e. known) individuals but where all communication is anonymous, be a more appropriate model for people looking to learn from each other about their struggles?</p>

<p>This could be anything from a fully anonymous mailing list, to creating one-to-one anonymous pen pals. I love the idea of being able to discuss and grow with &quot;anonymous founder of a web startup in East London&quot;, without all the concerns raised by either of us fully knowing who the other is.</p>

<p>Perhaps this has been tried already? Or already exists? Or is a crazy idea? I&#39;d love your thoughts.</p>
